# Functions

!!! note
    The core interface of (so we hope) all essential functions are *not* dependent on specialized types such as `OrthoPoly`/`OrthoPolyQ`.
    Having said that, for exactly those essential functions there exist overloaded functions that accept specialized types such as `OrthoPoly`/`OrthoPolyQ` as arguments.

    Too abstract?
    For example, the function `evaluate` that evaluates a polynomial of degree `n` at points `x` has the core interface
    ```
        evaluate(n::Int64,x::Array{Float64},a::Vector{Float64},b::Vector{Float64})
    ```
    where `a` and `b` are the vectors of recurrence coefficients.
    For simplicity, there also exists the interface
    ```
        evaluate(n::Int64,x::Vector{Float64},op::OrthoPoly)
    ```
    which is defined as
    ```
        evaluate(n::Int64,x::Vector{Float64},op::OrthoPoly) = evaluate(n,x,op.α,op.β)
    ```
    So fret not upon the encounter of multiply-dispatched versions of the same thing. It's there to simplify your life (so we hope).

    The idea of this approach is to make it simpler for others to copy and paste code snippets and use them in their own work.

## Recurrence Coefficients for Monic Orthogonal Polynomials
The functions below provide analytic expressions for the recurrence coefficients of common orthogonal polynomials.
All of these provide *monic orthogonal polynomials* relative to the weights.

!!! note
    The number `N` of recurrence coefficients has to be positive for all functions below.

## Show Orthogonal Polynomials

To get a human-readable output of the orthognoal polynomials there is the function `showpoly`

```@docs
showpoly
```

In case you want to see the entire basis, just use `showbasis`
```@docs
showbasis
```

Both of these functions make excessive use of
```@docs
rec2coeff
```
