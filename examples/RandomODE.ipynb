    "# Galerkin-based Solution of Random Differential Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how random differential equations can be solved using polynomial chaos expansions (PCE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A random differential equation is an ordinary differential equation that has random parameters, hence its solution is itself a (time-varying) random variable.\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest non-trivial example is the following scalar, linear ordinary differential equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{x}(t) = a x(t), \\quad x(0) = x_{0},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a$ is the realization of a Gaussian random variable $\\mathsf{a} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "Arguably, for every realization $a$ we can solve the differential equation and obtain\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = x_0 \\mathrm{e}^{a t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "from which we find that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln (x(t)) = \\ln (x_0) + at \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\ln(x_0) + \\mu t, (\\sigma t)^2).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In other words, the logarithm of the solution is normally distributed (so-called [log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to obtain this result numerically with the help of PCE.\n",
    "The first step is to define the (truncated) PCE for the random variable $\\mathsf{a}$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathsf{a} = \\sum_{i=0}^{L} a_i \\phi_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a_i$ are the so-called PCE coefficients, and $\\phi_i$ are the orthogonal basis polynomials.\n",
    "As the solution to the random differential equation is itself a random variable, we treat $x(t)$ as the realization of the random variable $\\mathsf{x}(t)$, and define its PCE\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathsf{x}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{L} x_i(t) \\phi_i.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The question is how to obtain the unknown PCE coefficients $x_i(t)$ from the known PCE coefficients $a_i$ relative to the orthogonal basis polynomials $\\phi_i$.\n",
    "This can be done using Galerkin projection, which is nothing else than projecting onto the orthogonal basis.\n",
    "Think of a three-dimensional space, in which you have placed some three-dimensional object.\n",
    "If you know project the silhouett of the object onto every axis of the three-dimensional space, then you are doing a Galerkin projection.\n",
    "With PCE the concept is equivalent, but the imagination has a harder time.\n",
    "The first step for Galerkin projection is to insert the PCEs\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=0}^{L} \\dot{x}_i(t) \\phi_i = \\sum_{j=0}^{L} a_j \\phi_j \\sum_{k=0}^{L} x_k(t) \\phi_k;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "the second step is to project onto every basis polynomial $\\phi_m$ for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, L$, and to exploit orthogonality of the basis.\n",
    "This gives\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{x}_m(t) \\langle \\phi_m, \\phi_m \\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{L} \\sum_{k=0}^{L} a_j x_k(t) \\langle \\phi_l \\phi_k, \\phi_m \\rangle \\quad m = 0, 1, \\dots, L.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Of course, the initial condition must not be forgotten:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_0(0) = x_0, \\quad x_m(0) = 0 \\quad m = 1, \\dots, L.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If we can solve this enlarged system of ordinary random differential equations, we can reconstruct the analytic solution.\n",

    "## Practice\n",
